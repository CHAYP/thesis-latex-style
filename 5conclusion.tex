\chaptertitle{CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION}

\section{Conclusion}
We prove that mistakes bound of rational kernel in 
group weakly linear separable case is converged up to group number.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Rational kernel can archives group weakly linear separable case with
$$
\gamma = \frac{\left[840\lceil\log_2(2L+2)\rceil\cdot\left\lceil\sqrt{\frac{2}{\gamma}}\right\rceil\right]^{-\frac{\lceil\log_2(2L+2)\rceil\cdot\left\lceil\sqrt{\frac{2}{\gamma}}\right\rceil}{2}}}{9\sqrt{L}}
$$.
    \item Kernelized Bandit Algorithm makes 
$$
K\cdot 2^{\tilde{O}(\sqrt{1/\gamma}\log L)}
$$
mistakes in group weakly separable case.
    \item If there is no group in a weakly separable case our boundary is as same as
\cite{BeygelzimerPSTWZ2019-separable}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Recommendations}

Notice that the rational kernel is the inner product in infinite dimension space
that can have a lot of vectors in Hilbert space that makes $\gamma$ smaller.
Can we state a separable case that more generally than a weakly separable case?
The boundary is quite loose but this is already very difficult to figure out, 
Can we find another kernel that is easier to analyze?
