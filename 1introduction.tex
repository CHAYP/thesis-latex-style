Bandit and Expert problems are sequential decision problem in which a player has a set of actions.
In each time step or round a player decide to pick an action from an action set and incur a loss associated with that action.
The goal is to minimize the sum of losses throught the decision order.
There are two observation models depending on information that a player knows.
In expert case a player knows every losses from every actions in every round.
In bandit case a player knows only the actual losses that picked by a player.
There are three strategies of bandit problems include stochastic, adversarial and markovian.
In adversarial bandit problems in each round an adversary assign a loss for each actions.*(simultaneously)
The performance of a player is measure by regret that is different of the total loss that a player incurred and 
the minimun loss of an action.
